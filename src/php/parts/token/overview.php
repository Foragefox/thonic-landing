                <p>Thonic is a utility token that employs two key strategies to ensure holding the token is profitable. The first strategy is BuyBack & Burn, which encourages price stability and increases the value of the token by reducing supply. Thonic has a total initial supply of 100,000,000,000 tokens. Following this, all profits generated from the platform and sale of the token will go directly to BB&B until a threshold of 95% of the token supply is burned.</p>
                <p>The second strategy is earning passive income with 5% of each transaction being redistributed to token holders in stablecoins. Built on the Binance Smart Chain for its fast block speeds and low transaction costs, Thonic is designed to be held long term to benefit from both passive income and capital appreciation.</p>
