                        <h4>Why we have a token:</h4>
                        <p>Thonic was born out of the recognition that alt coins offer a great investment opportunity but getting started in this world can feel very overwhelming. To help address this, we designed Thonic to be part educational tool (teach people the basics of alt coins) and part investment guide (to help people make educated crypto financial decisions). Too many people fall prey to rug pulls or other scams because there is no regulation in this industry and we would like to help mitigate this as much as we can. We believe in making educated decisions and that is fundamentally why we are here: to help find and vet alt coins so you can make well informed decisions.</p>
                        <p>If you are interested in alt coins and would like to start with learning more about this world before diving in, you can register to access our free courses. The reporting on the other hand can be accessed by holding $100 worth Thonic tokens. Another bonus to holding Thonic coins is you get to vote on which tokens we vet - an investment in us is an investment in your future after all!</p>
